## A Trump tweet generator using Markov Chains

There are many Trump tweet generators. This one is mine.

A corpus of both Trump's tweets (as of 8 Jan 2018) and speeches is used to generate a Markov Chain for random tweets.

Currently, it only generates the tweets.
I decided *not* to make it a twitter bot, as there are enough trumptwitbots already.

Requires [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify)
